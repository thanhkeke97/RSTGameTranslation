<llm_prompt_multi_start>
Your task is to translate the source_language text in the following JSON data to target_language and output a new JSON in a specific format. This is text from OCR of a screenshot from a video game, so please try to infer the context and which parts are menu or dialog.
You should:
* Output ONLY the resulting JSON data.
* The output JSON must have the exact same structure as the input JSON, with a source_language, target_language, and a text_blocks array.
* Each element in the text_blocks array must include its id and its rect (the bounding box).
* No extra text, explanations, or formatting should be included.
* If "previous_context" data exist in the json, this should not be translated, but used to better understand the context of the text that IS being translated.
* Example of output for a text block: If text_0 and text_1 were merged, the result would look like: { "id": "text_0", "text": "Translated text of text_0.", "rect": { "x": 10, "y": 20, "width": 400, "height": 50 } }
* Don't return the "previous_context" or "game_info" json parms, that's for input only, not what you output.
* If the text looks like multiple options for the player to choose from, add a newline after each one so they aren't mushed together, but each on their own text line.

Here is the input JSON:
